City Hall is set to clear more than Sh3 billion owed to suppliers after the High Court unlocked funds for the countyâ€™s Sh37.5billion budget.The county had not been able to spend any cash from the budget after former Governor Mike Sonko went to court to block its implementation while also refusing to sign warrants to enable the controller of budget to authorise release of the funds.However, acting Governor Benson Mutura has said after signing the warrants last month, the county government entered into a conditional arrangement with concerned parties to allow utilisation of some funds to keep operations at the county going.
