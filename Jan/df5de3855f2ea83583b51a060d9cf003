With the form of Uganda’s world record holder Cheptegei and with Farah back on the track after a lukewarm marathon cameo, the work is surely cut out for AK tacticians to plot for the gold in Tokyo.This can only be achieved through a conference between athletes, their managers, coaches, the federation and our legends like Tanui, Tergat and Kamathi who’ve been there, done that.We are tired of waiting for this 10,000m gold!
