Chesire also appealed to the International Olympics Committee to consider including the 56km race or the 90km race in the Olympics Games to create more opportunities to the athletes.“I would love to see athletes competing one day in the 56km or 90km race in the Olympics Games because it will create more opportunities for athletes whose numbers are growing.
