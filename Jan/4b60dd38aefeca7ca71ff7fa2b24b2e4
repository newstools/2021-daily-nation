Milan manager Stefano Pioli and Inter boss Antonio Conte played down the row after the match, saying they had not heard the players' arguing and blamed any tension on the fact the match was a Milan derby.But Italian daily La Repubblica said the clash was "a poor spectacle that spoilt a great game" while Corriere della Sera said it was a case of "one goal each, (but) a bad scenario for everyone". Corriere dello Sport called it a "shameful" episode.
