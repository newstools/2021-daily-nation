Before the accident, Froome made no secret of his ambition to equal the five Tour de France races won by Merckx, Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, but is now focussed on getting fully fit."I'd like to get to number five, and keep racing and targeting Grand Tours until I'm ready to retire from the sport on my own terms," he said.
