What you need to know:

The club’s fortunes have ebbed more than they have flowed over the years, their survival anchored in that idealism of being the “people’s club.”And unlike other outfits that have come and gone, Muthaiga RFC, Ruiru, Machakos SC, Thika SC, Kenya Breweries RFC, Barclays Bank RFC, Stanchart Bank RFC, Faru RFC, Ulinzi RFC etc, Mwamba --43 years old and counting, will stay and find a new home.
