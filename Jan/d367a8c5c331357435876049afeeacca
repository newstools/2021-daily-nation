What you need to know:

Last time I checked, moving to a club is a whole lot of ritual involving the club, the player and a host of agents in betweenIf any European club came up with such an offer to Olunga’s agent “Ghost” Mulee, then the good man must have kept quiet about it, which I highly doubt because all through Olunga’s career, “Ghost” has done his best to ensure the player gets the long end of the stickIn the absence of such an offer I believe Olunga did the next good thing by snapping up the Qatar deal
