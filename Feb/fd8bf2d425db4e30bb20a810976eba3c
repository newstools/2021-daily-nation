What you need to know:

It is little over 10 years ago that Arsenal famously blew a 4-0 lead to draw 4-4 with Newcastle.But there was no repeat as instead Mikel Arteta's men twice came closest to extending their lead as Aubameyang and Saka smashed shots off the post.A first win in four games takes Arsenal above Leeds in the table into 10th, but they are still six points adrift of their target of a top-four finish.
