On July 26, 1983, Kratochvílová, then aged 32, ran the 800 metres race in a blistering 1 minute, 53.28 seconds at an athletics meet in Munich, Germany. That was a world record in the two-lap race which, incidentally, is currently the longest-standing individual world record. The record turns 37 this year.Representing the former Czechoslovakia, Kratochvilova proceeded to win an unprecedented 400m and 800m double barely a month later at the inaugural edition of the World Athletics Championships.
