Thanks to challenges such as less interest from the corporate world and the government, the standards of football in Kenya at the moment are a pale show of those in the eighties and nineties, when Gor Mahia won a continental title and the men's national football team consistently qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations.The embarrassing returns by Kenyan teams has contributed led to football fans switching allegiance to “supporting” European teams, and especially those competing in the English Premier League. Thus, the match-fixing menace, if not nipped in the bud, has the capacity to end whatever is left of the game locally.
