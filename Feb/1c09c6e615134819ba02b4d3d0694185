Elvis Nandwa restored the soldiers' lead in the 75th minute and when they thought that they were destined for their first back-to-back and third win of the season, substitute Mohammed Mbaruk  netted Stima’s equaliser. The draw left Stima’s new coach Juma Abdallah chasing his first win of the season, having drawn 1-1 with Mathare in their previous match. With just one win so far this season, the Kisumu based side are second from bottom on seven points. Ulinzi Stars remain eighth on 14 points.
