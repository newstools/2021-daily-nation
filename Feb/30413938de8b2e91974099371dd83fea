In the first round of FKF Women's Cup, record league champions Vihiga Queens outclassed Division One team Royal Starlets 3-0 at Birunda grounds in Kitale to qualify for round of 16 matches,  which  start on  February 26. "It was a tough and very physical match because most of our opponents lacked match fitness and seemed to have been playing their first competitive game on Sunday, so they didn't understand some of the basic rules," Vihiga Queens coach Alex Alumirah said yesterday.
