What you need to know:

It was not a good round for Odoh as he dropped three straight shots after picking up a birdie at the second hole, dropped one more shot at the 12th for two over par 73 to drop to fourth, where he tied with John Wangai on four under par 209.â€œMy take off from the tee was just bad and it really made me drop a number of shots as I was struggling to make some recovery in almost every hole, but will see how it works tomorrow," said Odoh.
