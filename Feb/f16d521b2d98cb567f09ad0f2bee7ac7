What you need to know:

Nevertheless, Jennings' publications on corruption in Fifa did catch up with the world football body leading to the famous change in leadership at the world football body.  Please urge the delegates to vote for Mwendwa. If he is this good for Kenya, he must surely be good for Fifa as well, and will amply fulfill your motto: "For the game. For the world." Your loving football fan. Charles.
