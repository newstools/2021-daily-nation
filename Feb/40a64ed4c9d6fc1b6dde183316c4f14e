What you need to know:

Pique could only hack away Alessandro Florenzi's cross to the feet of the Mbappe, who clipped in his second, and then Kean headed home, left free at the back post by Lenglet. Navas almost gifted Barcelona a lifeline when his clearance met Griezmann's left foot and the ball drifted just wide of his own post. Instead, Mbappe landed the knock-out blow, teed up on the counter-attack and curling beautifully in the far corner.
