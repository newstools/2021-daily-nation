Football Kenya Federation Secretary General Barry Otieno said they will submit the name of Kenya’s representative at next season’s Caf Champions League Wednesday, since they have not received any communication from Caf, which pushed the deadline from June 30 to July 31. Tusker, who top the standings on 44 points, need a win to clinch the ticket, though a draw or even a loss will see them through, provided KCB don't win against Nzoia Sugar.
