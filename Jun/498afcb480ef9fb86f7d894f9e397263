Posta introduced Josephat Lopanga and Francis Nambite for Likono and Amos Kigadi respectively.Â Ten minites to time, Lopanga outpaced his marker on the right and beat goalkeeper Wanjala with a powerful low shot to the bottom left coner. Meja would have equalised moments later, but his header was easily saved by Opiyo.
