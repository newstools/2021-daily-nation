What you need to know:

Ayuko has been a navigator for Malik for the last two years and exuded confidence she will read the pace notes as accurately as possible.“Naivasha terrain is tricky and as a navigator, you must be spot on pace notes. If it rains the driving dramatically changes and if it remains dry again it is another tough battle because of the dust. As a team, we must be keen on the changing patterns and switch our game plan as the terrain changes.”
