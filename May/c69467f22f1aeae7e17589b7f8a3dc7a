What you need to know:

In 2018 and 2019 it was Neymar who was injured as PSG lost in the last 16 to Real Madrid and then Manchester United.This time it was Kylian Mbappe, handicapped by a calf knock that meant he was left on the bench in Tuesday's 2-0 semi-final second leg defeat against Manchester City, huddled up to keep warm on a bitter night in the north of England.Coach Mauricio Pochettino must have hoped his team, having lost 2-1 in the first leg, could stay in the tie long enough to make it worth risking Mbappe for the closing stages.
