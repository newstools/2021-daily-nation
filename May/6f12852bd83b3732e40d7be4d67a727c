What you need to know:

KCB are now top of the standings with 36 points after beating Bandari yesterday to displace Tusker who drew with Wazito 1-1 on Friday.My suggestion would be that that eight teams be identified by June 15 to play against each other in a bubble in a week-long competition to pick the rightful winner byJune 30 to prevent fixture manipulation.
