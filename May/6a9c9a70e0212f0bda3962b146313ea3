What you need to know:

It is the third final of Europe's elite club competition to be played between two Premier League sides, and the second in just three seasons, and so this is a match-up that underlines the strength of the cash-rich English game.Not so long ago, the idea of Chelsea and City meeting in the biggest club game of all would have been laughable.Their only previous encounter in a final came in 1986 in the short-lived Full Members Cup, when Chelsea won 5-4 at Wembley.
