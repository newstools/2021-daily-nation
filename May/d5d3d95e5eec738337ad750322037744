This leaves Football Kenya Federation to switch their focus to this year's inaugural Confederation of African Football (CAF) Women's Championship League qualifiers where Kenya Women Premier League side Vihiga Queens was selected by virtue of being the reigning champions as the club that will represent Kenya in the 11 team competition. The Women’s Champions League is scheduled to take place from July 17 to August 1 this year with Kenya as the hosts. The Federation was nominated after CECAFA requested them to host and FKF agreed to the request.
