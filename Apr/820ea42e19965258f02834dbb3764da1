What you need to know:

Barcelona are not the team they were and the Copa assumes far greater importance in a season of recovery under Koeman.Messi was sent off when Athletic won the Spanish Super Cup in January, an exhilarating contest that saw Inaki Williams' thunderbolt snatch a 3-2 victory after extra-time.The first against Real Sociedad was always going to be their best hope of winning the Copa del Rey for the first time since 1984.On Saturday, in the same city and the same stadium where they lost a fortnight ago, they will have a second chance.
