What you need to know:

Away from Gor Mahia, I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to former Harambee Starlets captain Florence Adhiambo on her appointment to the technical bench of the South Sudan national women’s football team “Bright Starlets.”What many of you might not know is that more than two decades ago, I was a football team manager and Adhiambo or ‘Kadualo’ was one of our dependable players. All the best, Florence.
