All our players are tested for Covid and we can still make that mandatory every two weeks with the help of the government; all players shall have been vaccinated against Covid-19 at resumption; the fans are still to be locked out of stadium and our players be given travel passes in and out of the counties.These are very small issues that we can enforce brilliantly; it is a small price to pay for continuation. It is a plea that if considered will save us from total demise.
