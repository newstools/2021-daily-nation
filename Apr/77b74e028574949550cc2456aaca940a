The mosquito is a creature of contradictions.The female mosquito simply wants to reproduce, but that is what makes her dangerous.Her delicate wings are a marvel, but her buzzing torments us. Her eyes are stunning, but they help her find our flesh.Her mouth is a perfect model for painless hypodermic needles but what it deposits in our veins could kill us and most of all her astounding survival skills means there are billions more of her.Â
