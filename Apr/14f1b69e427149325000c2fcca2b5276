Even within the bubble training camp, athletes and sports officials should resist a lax mentality and practice social distancing as well as sanitisation whether all of them within the camp have been vaccinated or not.We thank God for so far none of the athletes has reported any adverse effects as a result of the vaccine.Â  We continue to work on the logistics required for the upcoming athletics events in Kenya and elsewhere, including the World Relay Championships in Selesia, Poland on May 1-2.
