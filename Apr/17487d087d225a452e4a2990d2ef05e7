Meanwhile, Kenyan champions Kenya Prisons bounced back to winning ways thrashing home side KO Kelibia in straight sets (25-21,25-21,25-20) to move to second place in Pool “A” with seven points, one behind leaders CS Sfaxien of Tunisia. Lydia Maiyo, Meldine Sande and skipper Prackcides Agala were impressive for Prisons who now only need a win of any kind against Wolaita Sodo University on Monday to proceed to the last four.
