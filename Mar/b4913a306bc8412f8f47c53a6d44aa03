My humble appeal to President Uhuru Kenyatta is to reverse his directive on sports and allow football matches to continue.Itâ€™s going to be very tough to keep players without playing matches, meaning they will not get salaries from their respective clubs. The government should have put more emphasis on safeguarding players not halting leagues.
