What you need to know:

The 2019 winner, Italian Guido Migliozzi, says he is delighted being back, and that he has great memories for the Karen course.  “I like the pressure. I like to be on the course with my caddie starting every single shot with a good strategy. It’s the kind of feeling that you have when you are competing for a title.“It was not over until the very end (in 2019) because there were four, five players, only one shot apart. The second shot on the 18th, the last hole, was incredible.
