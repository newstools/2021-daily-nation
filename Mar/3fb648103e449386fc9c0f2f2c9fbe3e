What you need to know:

After Rwandese coach Cassa Mbungo was hired on a two-year contract last month,  Bandari last Friday officially hired former AFC Leopards assistant  coach Anthony “Modo” Kimani in the same capacity for one year. This has solved the problem of the technical bench and the team is good to go  with both tacticians having worked together at AFC Leopards. The squad has been stabilised following the return of Felly Mulumba who will help strengthen the central defence.
