The NBA and the players union agreed to hold Sunday's modified All-Star Game weekend, salvaging a scaled-down showcase after the pandemic scuttled plans to hold the event earlier in Indianapolis.This is the second straight year using the new scoring format which calls for an “Elam Ending,” which provides a target score during an untimed fourth quarter. Team LeBron dominated the first three quarters to take a 146-125 lead into the final quarter. That set a winning target score of 170 which Team LeBron easily achieved despite being outscored 25-24 in the fourth by Team Durant.
