Our worst nightmare ocurred on Friday when the State imposed a fresh lockdown and suspended sporting activities.This means the league will be stopped again and a fresh harsh economic period for players. Letâ€™s hope we learnt lessons and those concerned will treat players better.Stars should sign off from the Afcon qualifiers on a high.We pray that the new lockdown will not take as long as last time. We are optimistic!
