Twins Miriam and Martha, 14, were defiled by their father.Their elder sister was also defiled; now has mental health issues, has a baby and expecting another one from her dad.Some mothers accuse minors –when they are defiled - of having ‘snatched’ their husbands.Deep in poverty, these women depend on their morally deprived partners to provide for them.Girls disowned by their mothers who choose to side with abusive fathers and step-fathers are particularly afflicted.
