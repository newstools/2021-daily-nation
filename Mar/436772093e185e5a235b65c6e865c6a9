Mathare United coach Salim Ali has decried fatigue among his players, saying that gives their opponents an upper hand in the Thursday match. He however exhuded confidence that the Slum boys will bag their second win of the season and put to end a four run match winless streak.“We are playing two matches in the span of two days, while our opponents have rested since Friday last week. This has been the trend even in the past fixtures and that has affected my players,” said Ali.
