There has to be a solution to this quagmire. We are not in the business of blaming officials, but surely if you are an official of a perpetually broke club why not just resign quietly and go away?Last Monday, I read some frustration in the Kâ€™Ogalo Corner column where the writer was advising that Gor Mahia be disbanded and the club starts afresh. That too could work especially if it will take away all the officials so as to set the club free.
